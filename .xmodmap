! remap caps lock to escape
! Note: there is program xcape that can do the same with `xcape -e 'Mode_switch=Escape'. However,
! it sucks.
! 1. It keeps running in the background an actively intercepts the keys for some reason.
! 2. Running setxkbmap to change the layout (eg. between czech and english), it makes the xcape to
!    stop working.
! 3. Running xcape in a script after setxkbmap introduces a race condition in which there is window
!    between changing the layout and xcape taking effect. It is too easy to hit this window and get
!    stuck with Caps Lock on and no key to disable it.
! 4. Therefore, switching to xmodmaprc.
! 5. Note, this xmodmaprc keeps working even after changing keyboard layout with setxkbmap.
! 6. However, what xcape achieved in conjunction with xmodmap was that pressing Caps Lock effects an
!    Escape while holding Caps Lock and pressing h effects a Left arrow.
!
!    I don't see how to make it work without xcape, so Esc key will be Mode_switch to use with hjkl
!    as arrows. Lets see how that goes.

! remove Caps Lock functionality from Mode_switch
clear Lock
! Escape key effects Mode_switch
keycode 9 = Mode_switch
! Caps Lock key effects Escape
keycode 66 = Escape

! Escape key + hjkl = Left Right Up Down
keysym h = h H Left
keysym l = l L Right
keysym k = k K Up
keysym j = j J Down
